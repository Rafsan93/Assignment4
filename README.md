# Assignment4
This is a simple HTML based web-page i create for my CISC 3130 - Data Structure Course

<b>GOAL OF THIS ASSIGNMENT: </b>
The main goal of the assignment was presenting our work from assignment #3 in a nice HTML/CSS customized webpage. To make a platform to showcase our creativity. our assignment #3 was to chose a lyrics from a artist and using a data structure we had to print the word frequencies of that lyrics.

<b> MY PROCESS TO ACOMPLISH THIS ASSIGNMENT </b>
for my Assignment #3 i chosed the song "Starman by "David Bowie" from album "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and in my assignment #3 i found the word frequancy of the lyrics using TreeMap Data Structure in java. in this assignment i had to turn that java code to a webpage.

<b>WHY I CHOSE THIS DATA STRUCTURE</b>
For my code i used TreeMap data structue. TreeMap is a Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. Unlike LinkedHashMap and HashMap this data structure does not use hashing for storing keys. i chosed this perticular data structure mainly because it is simple and it also print output in alphabetical order which looks nice then random word list. HashMap has no ordering when you iterate through it; TreeMap iterates in the natural key order. also in my code i used a for loop and if-else statement.

<b>What I Want To Improve If I Had More Time</.b>

If i had more time i would use that to improve this webpage more. i would make it more user friendly. and i would use more css & javascript to customize it more. i would add more graphic in it. make the webpage more graphicaly designed webpage then just a html based webpage.

<b>HOW I SCALE THIS PROJECT</b>
I find this project very helpful and usefull to learn some new thins. although because of time constraint i coudn't try some new things like css & javascript. but i would love to continue in this even after the course is over. and love to use more css & javascript to make it more user friendly.
