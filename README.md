# Assignment4
This is a simple HTML based web-page i create for my CISC 3130 - Data Structure Course

<b>GOAL OF THIS ASSIGNMENT: </b>
The main goal of the assignment was presenting our work from assignment #3 in a nice HTML/CSS customized webpage. To make a platform to showcase our creativity. our assignment #3 was to chose a lyrics from a artist and using a data structure we had to print the word frequencies of that lyrics.

<b>ABOUT THE ARTIST</b>
David Bowie was born in South London's Brixton neighborhood on January 8, 1947. His first hit was the song "Space Oddity" in 1969. The original pop chameleon, Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character for his breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote "Fame" with Carlos Alomar and John Lennon, which became his first American No. 1 single in 1975. An accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who Fell to Earth in 1976. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Shortly after releasing his final album, Bowie died from cancer on January 10, 2016.

<b>ABOUT THE SONG</b>
The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, speaking to William S. Burroughs for Rolling Stone magazine in 1973, Ziggy Stardust is not the Starman but merely his earthly messenger – contrary to received opinion which often paints Ziggy as an extraterrestrial. The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the Second Coming of Christ, to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). The music is in a gentle pop rock vein, featuring prominent acoustic guitar and a string arrangement by Mick Ronson, not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album Hunky Dory (1971). The chorus is loosely based on Harold Arlen's "Over the Rainbow" from the film The Wizard of Oz, alluding to the "Starman"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on the word "Starman" is identical to that on the word "Somewhere" in "Over the Rainbow"). Other influences cited for the track are the T. Rex songs "Telegram Sam" and "Hot Love" (the "boogie" references and "la la la" chorus) and Holland–Dozier–Holland's "You Keep Me Hangin' On" (the morse code-esque guitar and piano breaks).

<b> MY PROCESS TO ACOMPLISH THIS ASSIGNMENT </b>
for my Assignment #3 i chosed the song "Starman by "David Bowie" from album "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars" and in my assignment #3 i found the word frequancy of the lyrics using TreeMap Data Structure in java. in this assignment i had to turn that java code to a webpage.

<b>WHY I CHOSE THIS DATA STRUCTURE</b>
For my code i used TreeMap data structue. TreeMap is a Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. Unlike LinkedHashMap and HashMap this data structure does not use hashing for storing keys. i chosed this perticular data structure mainly because it is simple and it also print output in alphabetical order which looks nice then random word list. HashMap has no ordering when you iterate through it; TreeMap iterates in the natural key order. also in my code i used a for loop and if-else statement.

<b>HOW I SCALE THIS PROJECT</b>
I find this project very helpful and usefull to learn some new thins. although because of time constraint i coudn't try some new things like css & javascript. but i would love to continue in this even after the course is over. and love to use more css & javascript to make it more user friendly.

<b>WHAT I WANT TO IMPROVE IF I HAD MORE TIME</b>
If i had more time i would use that to improve this webpage more. i would make it more user friendly. and i would use more css & javascript to customize it more. i would add more graphic in it. make the webpage more graphicaly designed webpage then just a html based webpage.
